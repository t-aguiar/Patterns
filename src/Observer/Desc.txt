Observer Pattern
    A one to many pattern that allows any listeners/observers to be notified of
    changes to a subject.
    In this example, it is a weather station that will update other views.
    Taken from Head First Design Patterns

    Subjects have a list of all their observers
    Observers have a reference to their subject
